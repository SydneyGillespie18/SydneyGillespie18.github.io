        <p> My first muscial was <I>Shrek the Musical<I>. I participated in this musical my freshman year of high school. It was this play that gave me my love for this form of art.

        <p> My second musical was <I>Beauty and the Beast<I>. In this play I played as a spoon in the ensemble. It was fun with the very different mucic and the message from <I>Shrek the Musical<I>.

        <p> My thrid musial was <I>Fiddler on the Roof<I> my junior year of high school. This mucial takes place in the year 1905 in a fictional town called Anatevka. It was a very hard play to do correctly because the Jewish faith is a huge part of the story.

        <p> My fourth musical was <I>Mamma Mia<I>. This was the most physically and vocally exhasting and fun of all four. The music is very upbeat and you are constatly moving.
