        <p>Bellow are images of quilts and scrunchies that I have created over the years. They each represent my hardwork and passion</p>

        <p> <h2> <b> <I>My Quilts:</I> </b> </h2> </p>
        <p>All of these quilts are projects that I have personally accomplished on my own or with the help of my grandmother. I use these in my everyday life and have given to family memebers to bring happiness to their life.</p>

        <p> <h2> <b> <i>My Scrunchies:</i> </b> </h2> </p>
        <p> These are a few pictures of scrunchies that I have personally made. I have made over 100 for myself, firends, and family members. I think they are easy to make and unlike quilts, they give instant gratification because one only takes about 5-7 minutes to make.
